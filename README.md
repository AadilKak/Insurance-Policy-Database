# Insurance-Policy-Database
The project involved developing an insurance policy management system, where a team of five worked collaboratively to design and implement the solution using Python, Live SQL, and CSS. The system included designing relational databases, creating functional forms, and generating reports to handle various queries related to insurance policies.

The project focused on back-end development and integration testing to ensure the systemâ€™s reliability and efficiency. Regular team meetings and diverse communication channels were used to coordinate tasks and foster skill development through constructive feedback.

Upon delivering the initial version of the system to clients, their feedback was collected and used to refine the application. The system was subsequently rewritten using .NET and Blazor, incorporating new technologies and adapting to different development environments to enhance functionality and performance.
